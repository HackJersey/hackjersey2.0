# Meta-Jersey
A journalism tool to be used for figuring out what's causing the New Jersey census shift. 

Meta-Jersey provides a tool for journalists that can aid them in understanding what is causing the change of the New Jersey census. By using a wide range of data, which is visualized on an interactive heat map, users will be able to see specific data on each individual town, allowing them to create a story based on the census data that is being visualized.
